## Full Module Documentation

All commands for the module have "Comment-Based Help" available at your fingertips.
You can access that help at any time by running:

```powershell
Get-Help -Full <commandName>
```

In addition to accessing it from the commandline, all of that help documentation is also available
online on our [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/wiki).

----------

## Logging

All commands will log to the console, as well as to a log file, by default.
The logging is affected by configuration properties (which can be checked with
`Get-GitHubConfiguration` and changed with `Set-GitHubConfiguration`).

 **`LogPath`** [string] The logfile. Defaults to
   `([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath('MyDocuments'))\PowerShellForGitHub.log`.  Will default to
   `([System.Environment]::GetFolderPath('LocalApplicationData'))\PowerShellForGitHub.log` when
   there is no user profile (like in an Azure environment).

 **`DisableLogging`** [bool] Defaults to `$false`.

 **`LogTimeAsUtc`** [bool] Defaults to `$false`. If `$false`, times are logged in local time.
    When `$true`, times are logged using UTC (and those timestamps will end with a Z per the
    [W3C standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime))

 **`LogProcessId`** [bool] Defaults to `$false`. If `$true`, the
    Process ID (`$global:PID`) of the current PowerShell process will be added
    to every log entry.  This can be helpful if you have situations where
    multiple instances of this module run concurrently and you want to
    more easily isolate the log entries for one process.  An alternative
    solution would be to use `Set-GitHubConfiguration -LogPath <path> -SessionOnly` to specify a
    different log file for each PowerShell process. An easy way to view the filtered
    entries for a session is (replacing `PID` with the PID that you are interested in):

```powershell
Get-Content -Path <logPath> -Encoding UTF8 | Where { $_ -like '*[[]PID[]]*' }
```

----------

## Telemetry

In order to track usage, gauge performance and identify areas for improvement, telemetry is
employed during execution of commands within this module (via Application Insights).  For more
information, refer to the [Privacy Policy](README.md#privacy-policy).

We recommend that you always leave the telemetry feature enabled, but a situation may arise where
it must be disabled for some reason.  In this scenario, you can disable telemetry by calling:

```powershell
Set-GitHubConfiguration -DisableTelemetry -SessionOnly
```

The effect of that value will last for the duration of your session (until you close your
console window).  To make that change permanent, remove `-SessionOnly` from that call.

The following type of information is collected:
 * Every major command executed (to gauge usefulness of the various commands)
 * Types of parameters used with the command
 * Error codes / information

The following information is also collected, but the reported information is only reported
in the form of an SHA512 Hash (to protect PII (personal identifiable information)):
 * Username
 * OwnerName
 * RepositoryName
 * OrganizationName

The hashing of the above items can be disabled (meaning that the plaint-text data will be reported
instead of the _hash_ of the data) by setting

```powershell
Set-GitHubConfiguration -DisablePiiProtection -SessionOnly
```

Similar to `DisableTelemetry`, the effect of this value will only last for the duration of
your session (until you close your console window), unless you call it without `-SessionOnly`.

The first time telemetry is tracked in a new PowerShell session, a reminder message will be displayed
to the user.  To suppress this reminder in the future, call:

```powershell
Set-GitHubConfiguration -SuppressTelemetryReminder
```

Finally, the Application Insights Key that the telemetry is reported to is exposed as

```powershell
Get-GitHubConfiguration -Name ApplicationInsightsKey
```
It is requested that you do not change this value, otherwise the telemetry will not be reported to
us for analysis.  We expose it here for complete transparency.

----------

## Common PowerShell API Patterns

This module adopts many of the standard PowerShell API design patterns.  We want to call attention
to those patterns here so that you can identify how you can most efficiently use the module.

### Confirmation Required for Major Actions

All commands that result in removing/deleting an object, as well as some commands that rename
objects (like renaming a repository) require user confirmation before the comamnd will be processed.
You can avoid that user confirmation by passing in either `-Confirm:$false` or `-Force`.

### WhatIf Supported for All State Changing Commands

Any command that _isn't_ `Get-GitHub*` supports the `-WhatIf` switch.  You can safely call that
command by passing in the `-WhatIf` switch and know that the request will not actually be sent
to GitHub.  This can be useful when paired with the `-Verbose` switch if you are examining what
is happening behind the scenes.

### State Changing Commands are Silent by Default

By default, state changing commands like `Set-*`, `Rename-*`, etc... will not produce any output
unless you specify the `-PassThru` switch.  You can change that default behavior by calling

```powershell
Set-GitHubConfiguration -DefaultPassThru:$true
```

----------

## Examples

### Overview

#### Embracing the Pipeline

One of the major benefits of PowerShell is its pipeline -- allowing you to "pipe" a saved value or
the output of a previous command directly into the next command.  There is absolutely no requirement
to make use of it in order to use the module, but you will find that the module becomes increasingly
easier to use and more powerful if you do.

Some of the examples that you find below will show how you might be able to use it to your advantage.

#### Pipeline Example

Most commands require you to pass in either a `Uri` for the repository or its elements (the
`OwnerName` and `RepositoryName`).  If you keep around the repo that you're interacting with in
a local var (like `$repo`), then you can pipe that into any command to avoid having to specify that
information.  Further, piping in a more specific object (like an `Issue`) allows you to avoid even
specifying the relevant Issue number.

Without the pipeline, an interaction log might look like this:

```powershell
# Find all of the issues that have the label "repro steps needed" and add a new comment to those
# issues asking for an update.
$issues = @(Get-GitHubIssue -OwnerName microsoft -RepositoryName PowerShellForGitHub -Label 'repro steps needed')
foreach ($issue in $issues)
{
    $params = @{
        'OwnerName' = 'microsoft'
        'RepositoryName' = 'PowerShellForGitHub'
        'Issue' = $issue.number
        'Body' = 'Any update on those repro steps?'
    }

    New-GitHubIssueComment @params
}

```

With the pipeline, a similar interaction log might look like this:

```powershell
# Find all of the issues that have the label "repro steps needed" and add a new comment to those
# issues asking for an update.
Get-GitHubRepository -OwnerName microsoft -RepositoryName PowerShellForGitHub |
    Get-GitHubIssue -Label 'repro steps needed' |
    New-GitHubIssueComment -Body 'Any update on those repro steps?'
```

We encourage you to explore how embracing the pipeline may simplify your code and interaction
with GitHub using this module!
