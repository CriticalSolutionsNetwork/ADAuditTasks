# PSScriptAnalyzer incorrectly flags a number of variables as PSUseDeclaredVarsMoreThanAssignments
# since it doesn't work well with variables defined in BeforeAll{} but only referenced in a later Context.
# We are suppressing that rule in Test files, which means that we are then losing out on catching
# scenarios where we might be assigning to a variable and then referencing it with a typo.
# By setting StrictMode, the test file will immediately fail if there are any variables that are
# being referenced before they were assigned.  It won't catch variables that are assigned to but
# never referenced, but that's not as big of a deal for tests.

    .SYNOPSIS
        Configures the tests to run with the authentication information stored in the project's
        Azure DevOps pipeline (if that information exists in the environment).

    .DESCRIPTION
        Configures the tests to run with the authentication information stored in the project's
        Azure DevOps pipeline (if that information exists in the environment).

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .NOTES
        Internal-only helper method.

        The only reason this exists is so that we can leverage CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessageAttribute,
        which can only be applied to functions.

        This method is invoked immediately after the declaration.
