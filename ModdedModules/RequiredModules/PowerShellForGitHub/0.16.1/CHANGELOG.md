## [0.15.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/tree/0.15.0) - (2020/08/16)

### Overview:

This is a significant update that has a number of breaking changes amongst its payload that
existing users need to be made aware of.

### Highlights:

+ Complete pipeline support has been added to the module.  You can now pipe the output of almost
  any command as input to almost any command.  Every command output now has a specific `GitHub.*`
  type that is queryable as well.

+ Major performance increase.  It turns out that showing animated status would make an operation
  take 3 seconds that would otherwise take 1/4 second due to performance issues with ProgressBar.
  We no longer show status except for commands that 10+ pages of results which we must query for,
  and that minimum can be changed with a new configuration property: `multiRequestProgressThreshold`
  (set it to `0` to never see any progress).

+ Lots of new functionality added:
  + Full support for gists: `Get-GitHubGist`, `Remove-GitHubGist`,
    `Copy-GitHubGist` (aka `Fork-GitHubGist`), `Add-GitHubGistStar`, `Remove-GitHubGistStar`,
    `Set-GitHubGistStar`, `Test-GitHubGistStar`, `New-GitHubGist`, `Set-GitHubGist`,
    `Rename-GitHubGistFile`, `Remove-GitHubGistFile`, `Set-GitHubGistFile` (aka`Add-GitHubGistFile`),
    `Get-GitHubGistComment`, `Set-GitHubGistComment`, `New-GitHubGistComment`,
    `Remove-GitHubGistComment`

  + Full support for Releases:
    `New-GitHubRelease`, `Set-GitHubRelease`, `Remove-GitHubRelease`, `Get-GitHubReleaseAsset`,
    `New-GitHubReleaseAsset`, `Set-GitHubReleaseAsset`, `Remove-GitHubReleaseAsset`

  + Improved support for Teams:
    `New-GitHubTeam`, `Set-GitHubTeam`, `Remove-GitHubTeam`, `Rename-GitHubTeam`

  + Dependabot support: `Test-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`,
    `Enable-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`, `Disable-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`,
    `Enable-GitHubRepositorySecurityFix`, `Disable-GitHubRepositorySecurityFix`

  + New Repository-related commands:
    `New-GitHubRepositoryFromTemplate`, `Set-GitHubContent`, `New-GitHubRepositoryBranch`,
    `Remove-GitHubRepositoryBranch`, `Get-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`,
    `New-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`, `Remove-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`

  + New Reaction support added for issues and pull requests:
    `Get-GitHubReaction`, `Set-GitHubReaction`, `Remove-GitHubReaction`

+ Default formatters have been added for many (but not yet all) of the types introduced by this
  module.  Formatter support will be increased over the coming releases.

+ No longer has any external dependencies.  Previously had to download .NET
  assemblies in order to send telemetry, which made the initial commands
  take up much more time than needed.  With no eternal dependencies involved
  anymore, telemetry is lightning-fast with negligible impact to normal
  command execution.

### Breaking Changes

#### Stardized naming (and verb usage) throughout the module

* A number of commands have been renamed to follow the pattern that we're standardizing on:
  `Get` / `Set` / `New` / `Remove`
  (but we will continue to alias `Remove-*` as `Delete-*`).
  * That resulted in the following command renames:
    * `Get-GitHubComment` -> `Get-GitHubIssueComment` `[Alias('Get-GitHubComment)]`
    * `New-GitHubAssignee` -> `Add-GitHubAssignee` `[Alias('New-GitHubAssignee')]`
    * `New-GitHubComment` -> `New-GitHubIssueComment` `[Alias('New-GitHubComment)]`
    * `Remove-GitHubComment` -> `Remove-GitHubIssueComment` `[Alias('Remove-GitHubComment)]`
    * `Set-GitHubLabel` -> `Initialize-GitHubLabel` _[breaking behavior due to the `Update-GitHubLabel` change below]_`
    * `Update-GitHubCurrentUser` -> `Set-GitHubProfile` `[Alias('Update-GitHubCurrentUser')]`
    * `Update-GitHubIssue` -> `Set-GitHubIssue`  `[Alias('Update-GitHubIssue')]`
    * `Update-GitHubLabel` -> `Set-GitHubLabel`  `[Alias('Update-GitHubLabel')]`
      _[breaking behavior since `Set-GitHubLabel` used to do something else]_
    * `Update-GitHubRepository` -> `Set-GitHubRepository`  `[Alias('Update-GitHubRepository')]`

* The following parameter renames occurred as well:
  * `Add-GitHubIssueLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`
  * `Get-GitHubCodeOfConduct`: `Name` -> `Key`
  * `Get-GitHubProjectCard`: `ArchivedState` -> `State` (although we kept an alias for `ArchivedState`)
  * `Get-GitHubLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`, `Milestone` -> `MilestoneNumber`
  * `Get-GitHubLicense`: `Name` -> `Key`
  * `Get-GitHubRelease`: `ReleaseId` -> `Release` (although we kept an alias for `ReleaseId`)
  * `Get-GitHubRepositoryBranch`: `Name` -> `BranchName`
  * `Get-GitHubUser`: `User` -> `UserName` (although we kept an alias for `User`)
  * `Get-GitHubUserContextualInformation`: There is no longer `SubjectId` and `Subject`.
     Instead you either specify `OrganizationId`, `RepositoryId`, `IssueId` or `PullRequestId`.
  * `Move-GitHubProjectCard`: `ColumnId` -> `Column` (although we kept an alias for `ColumnId`)
  * `New-GitHubLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`
  * `New-GitHubProject`: `Name` -> `ProjectName` (although we kept an alias for `Name`)
  * `New-GitHubProjectCard`: There is no longer `ContentId` and `ContentType`.
     Instead you either specify `IssueId` or `PullRequestId`.
  * `New-GitHubProjectColumn`: `Name` -> `ColumnName` (although we kept an alias for `Name`)
  * `Remove-GitHubIssueLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`
  * `Remove-GitHubLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`
  * `Rename-GitHubRepository`: `html_url` alias for `Uri` has been removed
  * `Set-GitHubIssueLabel`: `Name` -> `Label`
  * `Set-GitHubLabel` (formerly `Update-GitHubLabel`): `Name` -> `Label`
  * `Set-GitHubProjectColumn`: `Name` -> `ColumnName` (although we kept an alias for `Name`)
  * `Set-GitHubRepositoryTopic`: `Name` -> `Topic` (although we kept an alias for `Name`)

#### Other breaking changes

* All `Remove-*` functions (and some `Rename-*`/`Set-*` functions) now prompt for confirmation before
  performing the requested action.  This can be silently bypassed by passing-in `-Confirm:$false`
  or `-Force`.
  * Affected commands that existed in previous releases:
    * `Remove-GitHubAssignee`
    * `Remove-GitHubIssueComment` (formerly named `Remove-GitHubComment`)
    * `Remove-GitHubIssueLabel`
    * `Remove-GitHubLabel`
    * `Remove-GitHubMilestone`
    * `Remove-GitHubProject`
    * `Remove-GitHubProjectCard`
    * `Remove-GitHubProjectColumn`
    * `Remove-GitHubRepository`
    * `Rename-GitHubRepository`
    * `Set-GitHubLabel` (formerly named `Update-GitHubLabel`)
    * `Set-GitHubRepository` (only affected when being used to rename the repository)

* Some parameters have had their type updated:
  * `Comment`: `[string]` -> `[int64]`
  * `Issue`/`IssueNumber`: `[string]`/`[int]` -> `[int64]`
  * `Milestone`/`MilestoneNumber`: `[string]` -> `[int64]`
  * `PullRequest`/`PullRequestNumber`: `[string]`/`[int]` -> `[int64]`
  * `Release`/`ReleaseId`: `[string]` -> `[int64]`

* `WhatIf` support changes:
  * Only GitHub state-changing commands now support `-WhatIf` (which means `Get-GitHub*` and
    `Test-GitHub*` no longer support `-WhatIf`).
  * All other `-WhatIf`-supporting commands will only have a single `-WhatIf` output.

* The `NoStatus` parameter has been removed from all functions due to the change in status behavior
  as descried above.  The `DefaultNoStatus` configuration value has also been removed for the same
  reason.

* All state-changing functions are now silent by default (no resulting output).  If you want them
  to return the result, you can pass in `-PassThru`, which is a PowerShell standard design pattern.
  To truly get back to previous module behavior, you can set the new configuration property:
  `DefaultPassThru`.

* `Get-GitHubTeam` and `Get-GitHubTeamMember` no longer support the `TeamId` parameter, as that
  functionality has been deprecated by GitHub.  You can use `TeamSlug` instead.

### Features

+ Complete pipeline support has been added to the module.  You can now pipe the output of almost
  any command as input to almost any command.  Every command output now has a specific `GitHub.*`
  type that is queryable as well.

+ All removal functions (and some rename functions) now prompt for confirmation.  This can be silently
  disabled with `-Confirm:$false`.  A later change will add support for using `-Force` as well.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/174) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/a6a27aa0aa1129d97bb6e5188707ff3ef6d53549)

+ All commands that require confirmation now accept `-Force` in addition to `-Confirm:$false`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/226) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/3c642d2e686725f7b17ad096c1f04d7d3777f733)

+ Telemetry no longer has any external dependencies.  We used to have to download .NET assemblies
  in order to send telemetry, and the downloading of those binaries took up time.  Telemetry
  reporting has now been completely implemented within PowerShell, removing all external dependencies.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/186) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/ae8467f74a8bae1b97ca808a3b6eec727d15fc7e)

+ Added additional options to `Update-GitHubRepository` (later renamed to `Set-GitHubRepository`):
  `DeleteBranchOnMerge` and `IsTemplate`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/192) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/ef246cd5b2a8a1d5646be8f1467e304cf27aabd4)

+ Added Dependabot service functions: `Test-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`,
  `Enable-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`, `Disable-GitHubRepositoryVulnerabilityAlert`,
  `Enable-GitHubRepositorySecurityFix`, `Disable-GitHubRepositorySecurityFix`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/235) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/b70c7d433721bcbe82e6272e32979cf2e5c5e1d8)

+ Added `New-GitHubRepositoryFromTemplate` which can create a new GitHub repository from a specified
  template repository.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/221) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/d96541ee5e16a3b9e11a52994a26540b203fb22c)

+ Added `Set-GitHubContent` and added a `BranchName` parameter to `Get-GitHubContent`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/241) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/a1f5e935165b2c606f81089524e89da9bb8b851d)

+ Added default "views" for all types exposed in GitHubRepositories.ps1: `GitHub.Repository`,
  `GitHub.RepositoryTopic`, `GitHub.RepositoryContributor`, `GitHub.RepositoryContributorStatistics`,
  `GitHub.RepositoryCollaborator`, `GitHub.RepositoryTag`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/205) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/41de3adb29ed583f775ce30e52c3d6ed8ade35ff)

+ Standardized verb usage and parameter naming throughout the module.  This is great for long-term
  maintainability of the module, but it does introduced breaking changes from 0.14.0.  The breaking
  changes are covered more completely, above.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/228) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/e57a9563ef68f3a897c2b523e5ea0cbf23011d4c)

+ Overhauled how status works for the module.  No longer shows an animation while invoking a web
  request.  This has the side effect of simplifying the code and significantly speeding-up the
  module.  This deprecates `NoStatus` and `DefaultNoStatus`.  This adds
  `MultiRequestProgressThreshold` to control how many pages of results are needed before a command
  will show status of completion across the full number of pages being retrieved.  This defaults to
  10.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/253) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/2740026e64f2246d3b10bd3ccca197ea4ca3c9d8)

+ Added `New-GitHubRepositoryBranch` and `Remove-GitHubRepositoryBranch`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/256) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/d76f54b08ea7c3f3355ec188827fadc0035d0595)

+ Updated `New-GitHubRepositoryBranch` to better support pipeline input, and added `Sha` as an
  optional parameter to allow for arbitrary commit branch creation.  Also added `Sha` as a top-level
  property to a `GitHub.Branch` object.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/277) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/3e79c2592ce0f062c52d95f2de2c87cbff40e8ea)

+ Added GitHub Reactions support for Issues and Pull Requests: `Get-GitHubReaction`,
  `Set-GitHubReaction`, `Remove-GitHubReaction`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/193) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/8e55f5af03aa0ae2d402e52b7cd50ca43ded03a7)

+ Added complete support for the GitHub Releases API surface: `New-GitHubRelease`,
  `Set-GitHubRelease`, `Remove-GitHubRelease`, `Get-GitHubReleaseAsset`, `New-GitHubReleaseAsset`,
  `Set-GitHubReleaseAsset`, `Remove-GitHubReleaseAsset`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/177) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/356af2f5b69fa8cd60bc77670d250cde796ac1d6)

+ Added complete support for the GitHub gists API surface: `Get-GitHubGist`, `Remove-GitHubGist`,
  `Copy-GitHubGist` (aka `Fork-GitHubGist`), `Add-GitHubGistStar`, `Remove-GitHubGistStar`,
  `Set-GitHubGistStar`, `Test-GitHubGistStar`, `New-GitHubGist`, `Set-GitHubGist`,
  `Rename-GitHubGistFile`, `Remove-GitHubGistFile`, `Set-GitHubGistFile` (aka`Add-GitHubGistFile`),
  `Get-GitHubGistComment`, `Set-GitHubGistComment`, `New-GitHubGistComment`,
  `Remove-GitHubGistComment`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/172) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/92c4aa8b3a0142752e68a50af73ac276db0c1ff6)

+ Added branch protection rule commands: `Get-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`,
  `New-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`, `Remove-GitHubRepositoryBranchProtectionRule`
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/255) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/981b85c2d49172df531bee641c9554a425181625)

+ Standardized and improved the `WhatIf` support throughout the entire module.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/254) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/2f16de1f46611a89cd833429f6227c83b5563e84)

+ Added additional support for Teams: `New-GitHubTeam`, `Set-GitHubTeam`, `Remove-GitHubTeam`, and
  adds `TeamName` as an additional way to call into `Get-GitHubTeam`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/257) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/6a51601ec841a52e1fa95cf0e2e0a6fd1100269a)

+ Minor improvements to the new Teams commands to better support pipeline input and to provide
  alternative calling patterns (which can specify a team's `slug` or parent team's `TeamId` in order
  to minimize additional queries that would have to be done internally to complete your request).
  Added `Rename-GitHubTeam` as well.
  This _also_ removes `TeamId` as a way to call `Get-GitHubTeam` or `Get-GitHubTeamMember`, as
  those API's have been deprecated by GitHub.  You can now speficy a `TeamSlug` instead.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/275) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/9ef3c2b5670fc7b640a47a33d0aa725c63319839)

* All state-changing functions are now silent by default (no resulting output).  If you want them
  to return the result, you can pass in `-PassThru`, which is a PowerShell standard design pattern.
  To truly get back to previous module behavior, you can set the new configuration property:
  `DefaultPassThru`.

### Fixes

- Module update check needs to be able to handle when the module in use is newer than the published
  version (since publication to PowerShellGallery happens a few hours after the version is updated
  in GitHub).
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/204) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/efdcbfa4a086bd4606ec2c32ef67db8553711781)

- Simplified `-WhatIf` handling within `Invoke-GHRestMethod` to only have a single `ShouldProcess`
  statement.  This was the first attempt at simplifying how `-WhatIf` should work.  There was a
  successive change that took things further (see below).
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/213) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/ad15657551d137c5db063b64f15c2760f74ac5af)

- Some commands were not properly validating the `OwnerName`/`RepositoryName` input due to a
  misconfiguration.  That has now been fixed.

- Added a `ValidateSet` to the `Affiiliation` parameter in `Get-GitHubRepository` to limit input to
  the set of permitted options. Comment-based help was updated for `Get-GitHubRepositoryCollaborator`
  and `Move-GitHubRepositoryOwnership`.  Removed an unreachable codepath in `Get-GitHubRepository`.

- Fixes to module version update checking: Fixed regression introduced by the
  [pipeline work](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/242), and suppressed
  its usage of the progress bar to speed it up further.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/tree/0.14.0) - (2020/05/30)

### Features

+ The module will now asynchronously check for updates up to once per day.  This can be disabled
  if desired with the `Set-GitHubConfiguration -DisableUpdateCheck`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/185) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/a9f48a8aec796195664c3d86eb11755a1394d34e)
+ It turns out that `Group-GitHubPullRequest` which was written back in `0.2.0` was never actually
  exported.  Now it is.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/180) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/b7e1ea1cb912493e110b9854b0ec7700462254a0)

### Fixes

- Fixes the behavior of `Get-GitHubRepository`.  It actually had a number of issues:
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/179) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/c4c1ec344a357489d248b9cf1bc2837484d4915f)
  - `-GetAllPublicRepositories` didn't acutally work.  Now it does, along with the newly
     added `Since` parameters.
  - Fixed the ParameterSet handling for all parameters to make sure that users can only specify
    the correct combination of parameters.
- Fixes multi-result behavior across all versions of PowerShell.  You can now reliably capture
  the result of an API call like this: `@(Get-GitHubRepository ...)` and be assured that you'll
  get an array result with the proper count of items.  As a result, this fixes all remaining failing
  UT's on PowerShell 7.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/199) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/bcd0a5616e1395ca480bc7f3b64776eada2a6670)
- Fixed an erroneous exception that occurred when calling `New-GitHubRepository` when specifying
  a `TeamId`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/196) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/587e2042621091c79cc06be2aa9cc6ea836561f4)
- The module is now PSScriptAnalyzer clean (again).  This also fixed pipeline handling in
  `Group-GitHubPullRequest`, `Group-GitHubIssue` and `ConvertFrom-GitHubMarkdown`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/180) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/b7e1ea1cb912493e110b9854b0ec7700462254a0)

  plans.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/191) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/3c70b8d2702a4a7b5674bb72decacb385f1a47a8)
- Fixed a bug preventing quering for a specifically named branch with `Get-GitHubRepositoryBranch`.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/188) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/5807d00ed0a3acd293057d8a9c06a9d68b6030db)
- Correctly fixed the hash that catches whether or not a developer has updated the settings file used
  when running this module's unit tests.  It involved updating the hash and then also ensuring we
  always check the file out with consistent line endings.
  [[pr]](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellForGitHub/pull/181) | [[cl]](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub/commit/93689d69eedc50f084982a6fba21183857507dbb) &&

### Fixes

- Made parameter ordering consistent across all functions (OwnerName is now first, then RepositoryName)
- Normalized all parameters to use SentenceCase
- All functions that can take a Uri or OwnerName/RepositoryName now support both options.
- Made all parameter names consistent across functions:
  - `GitHubAccessToken` -> `AccessToken`
  - `RepositoryUrl` -> `Uri`
  - `Organization` -> `OrganizationName`
  - `Repository` -> `RepositoryName`
  - `Owner` -> `OwnerName`
- Normalized usage of Verbose, Info and Error streams

### Functionality Modified from 0.1.0:

* `New-GitHubLabels` was renamed to `Set-GitHubLabel` and can now optionally take in the labels
  to apply to the Repository.
* `Get-GitHubIssueForRepository` has been removed and replaced with `Get-GitHubIssue`.
  The key difference between these two is that it no longer accepts multiple repositories as single
  input, and filtering on creation/closed date can be done after the fact piping the results into
  `Where-Object` now that the returned objects from `Get-GitHubIssue` have actual `[DateTime]` values
  for the date properties.  For an updated example of doing this, refer to [example usage](USAGE.md#querying-issues).
* `Get-GitHubWeeklyIssueForRepository` has been removed and functionally replaced by `Group-GitHubIssue`.
  For an updated example of using it, refer to [example usage](USAGE.md#querying-issues)
* `Get-GitHubTopIssueRepository` has been removed.  We have [updated examples](USAGE.md#querying-issues)
  for how to accomplish the same scenario.
* `Get-GitHubPullRequestForRepository` has been removed and replaced with `Get-GitHubPullRequest`.

* `Get-GitHubTopPullRequestRepository` has been removed.  We have [updated examples](USAGE.md#querying-pull-requests)
  for how to accomplish the same scenario.
* `Get-GitHubRepositoryNameFromUrl` and `GitHubRepositoryOwnerFromUrl` have been removed and
  functionally replaced by `Split-GitHubUri`
* `Get-GitHubRepositoryUniqueContributor` has been removed.  We have an
  [updated example](USAGE.md#querying-contributors) for how to accomplish the same scenario.
* `GitHubOrganizationRepository` has been removed.  You can now retrieve repositories for an
  organization via `Get-GitHubRepository -OrganizationName <name>`.
* `Get-GitHubAuthenticatedUser` has been replaced with `Get-GitHubUser -Current`.
